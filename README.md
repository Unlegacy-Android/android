To get started with this ROM, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/samkenxstream/turnkey-triumph-326606_SamkenX_Android.git -b aosp-6.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
